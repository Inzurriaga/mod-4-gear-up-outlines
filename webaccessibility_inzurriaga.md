# Mod 4 Gear Up Overview

## Purpose

When employers hear about Gear Up, they are immediately intrigued.  <i>Most companies can teach you technical skills, new frameworks, new languages, but they do not have the time to teach you how to be a great team member, how to be inclusive, or how to discuss topics of diversity.</i>

As you go into the job hunt, being able to talk about ways you have lead in the community and talking about issues of diversity and inclusion will set you apart from other candidates. 

<b>The purpose of Gear Up is to have students build perspective and expertise connecting their technical work to the impact on their peers, community, and world. We want students are equipped to help realize our vision of a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it.</b>

Name of your Gear Up Presentation: web accessibility

Introduction of yourself: FE MOD 4 gabriel inzurriaga

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? theres alot of sites out there that dont follow ADA standards so they limit their usage of there site and also prevent people who want to use their site to struggle

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: many sites today dont follow ada standards this doesnt only affect small companies but also big ones like mcdonalds and a recent one sush as the beyonce site

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? there shouldnt be a barrier to prevent someone from using the web 

How will this impact you as a developer? when i make code ill make sure to follow the ada 

Write 2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation: 
1. sites they seen that might not follow ada standards
2. ways they can help
3. other methods they can add on to the ada standard

Anything additional you are adding to your talk? nope
