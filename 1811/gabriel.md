Name of your Gear Up Presentation: web accessibility

Introduction of yourself: FE MOD 4 gabriel inzurriaga

Why did you select this topic? Why is it of interest? theres alot of sites out there that dont follow ADA standards so they limit their usage of there site and also prevent people who want to use their site to struggle

Detailed description of the topic/history of the topic: many sites today dont follow ada standards this doesnt only affect small companies but also big ones like mcdonalds and a recent one sush as the beyonce site

How does this connect to mission of Gear Up? there shouldnt be a barrier to prevent someone from using the web

How will this impact you as a developer? when i make code ill make sure to follow the ada
